# Overview
View the Medium blog for this tutorial [here](https://medium.com/react-native-training/building-chatty-a-whatsapp-clone-with-react-native-and-apollo-part-1-setup-68a02f7e11).

This tutorial was created using [tortilla](https://github.com/Urigo/tortilla), an incredible framework for building tutorials.

Starting with the very first commit, every commit in Chatty represents the next step in the tutorial. Follow the tutorial for a guided walk through the code, or investigate a commit to see exactly what code changed for a given step. Since this is git, you can even download the app at any step in the tutorial -- how cool is that?!
